# Lab

In this lab you will install a generative AI tool of your choice. For a cost effective
solution that has a good free tier we recommend [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli).

If you are already paying a subscription to [Claude](https://claude.ai) then you can install their Claude Code tool as well [following these instructions](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)

Finally, you can also explore using GitHub's Copilot with their [free offering](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/copilot-billing/about-individual-copilot-plans-and-benefits), although this course doesn't cover GitHub Copilot.
