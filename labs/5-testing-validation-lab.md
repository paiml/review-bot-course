# Lab

In this last step you will compare your Code Review Bot to what you have built.

## Setup

Use the [PMAT Action](https://github.com/paiml/pmat-action) in your repository with your own code project and set it to analyze the complexity.

## Tasks

1. Cofigure the PMAT tool in a GitHub Actions workflow in a code project you own
2. Explore the different results and update the threshold for complexity if needed
3. Add your own tool and compare results.
4. Explore Additional features for your own bot and expand them with AI assitants


By the end of this lab you should have a solid foundation for a Code Review Bot of your own using GitHub Actions. You are ready to perhaps publish it to the Marketplace to share it with others even though this is not required.

Explore additional features for your bot and don't forget to enhance it with a powerful and useful README.md file for your users.
