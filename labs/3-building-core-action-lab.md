# Lab

In this lab you will start exploring the capabilities of the AI services you've chosen. Determine the exact solution you want to implement and populate the README.md of your action with all the technical aspects.

## Setup

In your GitHub repository for the action, create a detailed README.md file with instructions to start scaffolding and building your action.

## Tasks

1. Gather relevant documentation for the project you want to build
2. Create an initial prompt outlining your project goals and requirements
3. Tell the AI tool to use the README.md as the primary reference to build your project.
4. Submit the prompt along with key points from the documentation to the LLM
5. Review and refine the LLM's response to get a structured outline of steps
6. Implement the first step from the outline, using the LLM for clarification if needed
