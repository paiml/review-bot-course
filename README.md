# Developing a Code Review Bot

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Developing a Code Review Bot" course! This course will guide you through the process of building your own AI-powered code review bot using GitHub Actions. You'll learn how to automate code reviews, leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for development, and create a valuable tool to improve your development workflow.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

*   Understand the fundamentals of GitHub Actions.
*   Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for code analysis and feedback.
*   Build a functional code review bot from scratch.
*   Define and implement custom review criteria and standards.
*   Test and refine your bot for optimal performance.
*   Publish your bot to the GitHub Marketplace.

## What You'll Build

You will build a GitHub Action that acts as a code review bot. This bot will:

*   Analyze pull requests in your repositories.
*   Provide intelligent feedback and suggestions based on your defined criteria.
*   Help you maintain code quality and consistency.
*   Automate the code review process to save you time and effort.

## Labs

This course includes a series of labs to provide you with hands-on experience. Each lab corresponds to a lesson and will guide you through the practical steps of building your code review bot.

*   [Lab 1: Introduction to Code Review Automation](labs/1-introduction-lab.md)
*   [Lab 2: Planning Your Code Review Bot](labs/2-planning-lab.md)
*   [Lab 3: Building the Core Action](labs/3-building-core-action-lab.md)
*   [Lab 4: Advanced Bot Features](labs/4-advanced-features-lab.md)
*   [Lab 5: Testing and Validation](labs/5-testing-validation-lab.md)
